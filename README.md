## Setting up PlatformIO

<a id="sublime-text-3"></a>
### Sublime Text 3

**Note:** You may need certain other specific tools to be installed manually. For example the Arduino IDE.

Follow these official instructions:

* https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/sublimetext.html


In sublime text editor:

* Type: `CTRL+SHIFT+P` to bring up command window
* Type: `Package Control: Install Package`
* Wait for Package Control directory listings to get loaded up
* Type: `Deviot`, and hit `<RETURN>` key

Then open a terminal window. For example if you have the `Terminus` package installed then `CTRL+SHIFT+P` then `Terminus: Toggle Panel`.

In terminal, navigate into this project root folder `arduino-fan-pwm`, and then type:

```sh
pio project init --ide sublimetext --board uno
```

### VSCode

There are already many tutorials out there, for how to install PlatformIO extension within VSCode IDE. And get things working.

```sh
pio project init --ide vscode --board uno
```

## Credits

This is a combined effort, after watching many educational videos explaining PID control algorithm. An also after gathering multiple arduino sketches / examples from around the web. And merging everything together.

<a id="timers"></a>
## timers

<a id="atmega328p-uno"></a>
### atmega328p (uno)

<a id="timer0"></a>
#### timer0

* used by `init()` function, called automatically by arduino IDE before `setup()`
* counts 1 time per `millisecond`, for the `millis()` funtion

<a id="timer1"></a>
#### timer1

<a id="timer2"></a>
#### timer2

* has a higher priority than timers 0 and 1
