## Credits

This is a combined effort, after watching many educational videos explaining PID control algorithm. An also after gathering multiple arduino sketches / examples from around the web. And merging everything together.

### atmega328p (uno)

<a id="timer0"></a>
#### timer0

* used by `init()` function, called automatically by arduino IDE before `setup()`
* counts 1 time per `millisecond`, for the `millis()` funtion

<a id="timer1"></a>
#### timer1

<a id="timer2"></a>
#### timer2

* has a higher priority than timers 0 and 1
